TBH, 99 percent of this has just been me wanting to learn linux / unix / linux sockets in python and play around with linux. Although I am quite happy with the direction it's taking. If you're gonna run a Windows server, which I actually do reccomend, you'll need the pycrypto library installed, and a copy of python, preferably 3.5.

Dependencies:
-- PyCrypto  v  2.6.1  :  https://github.com/nsrathjen/pycrypto-py3.5-win64-binary/blob/master/pycrypto-2.6.1.win-amd64-py3.5.exe
-- Python    v  3.5.2  :  https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-352/

Keep in mind: code is still messy as shiz, but it uses some fun encryption, and really feels like a true linux program.
CLIENT WILL NOT RUN ON WINDOWS. But that could be fixed, if you wanna fix that, and change my methodology I'm sure its not too hard. Go ahead and do that if you want.
